Since the aim is to maintain the value of the passive investments held by the Fund (bank deposits, bonds, mortgage- bonds, loans, etc.), the Board of Directors shall make such additions to the Fund's capital in respect of such investments as are approximately equivalent to what is necessary to maintain their value measured in unchanged krona. B. Three quarters of the amount which the Board of Directors decides to distribute in the year in question shall be used for benefits to the relatives of the founders, preferably descendants. However, as long as Alice S√∏rensen is alive, she shall be entitled to the entire distribution, but only up to an amount of DKK 300 000, which shall be adjusted in line with the increase in the consumer price index from 1 January 1984. The degree of kinship with the founders is the main guideline for who is eligible for distribution and in what order, with descendants in principle having priority, but within the circle of relatives the Board of Trustees decides independently to which persons and in what amounts distribution is to be made, and no one has a legal claim to distribution from the Fund except Mrs Alice S√∏rensen. As far as distributions to descendants are concerned, it is up to the Fund's Board of Trustees to decide how each descendant manages his or her allocation. However, the Board of Trustees may decide, where it is deemed to be in the best interests of a descendant, that the allocation to that person shall be administered by a person appointed by the Board of Trustees. The administration may be carried out in such a way that the allocation may be made on a daily basis, possibly in the form of payment in kind, payment of rent, etc. If the Board of Trustees arranges for such administration, the descendant may request that the question of the entitlement to the advance be referred to three arbitrators appointed by the Civil Court in Esbjerg. The decision of the arbitrators is final and cannot be appealed to the courts. C. One quarter of the amount which the Board decides to allocate in the year in question shall be used to promote Danish fisheries, to honour persons who have rendered special services to the promotion of Danish fisheries or for other non-profit purposes, at the discretion of the Board. If the Board of Directors finds that there are no non-profit-making purposes in the year in question which can reasonably be taken into consideration, it may use the fourth part referred to above to honour well-deserving persons who have been employed by A/S Rederiet Tage S√∏rensen, Lumino-Fabrikken or other Tage S√∏rensen or Foundation-owned companies. D. If at any time there are no descendants or other beneficiaries, the funds available for distribution shall be used for the purposes mentioned under C. Paragraph 2.
